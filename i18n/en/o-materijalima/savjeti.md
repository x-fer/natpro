Within these materials, there will be examples of tasks you can try to solve to check how much you have learned. All examples will be from the [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com). For this reason, we advise you to open a free account on this page so that you can track your own progress, and in time you can start participating in the competitions they organize.

Competitions on the Codeforces platform are divided into three categories. Div. 3 is a category for absolute beginners (so-called newbies) and competitions are rarely held in this category. Div. 2 is a category for those a little more advanced and competitions in this category are held relatively often. Div. 1 is a category for advanced developers and competitions in this category are rarely held.

Our advice is to try the _Virtual participation_ option of a contest (e.g. [this one](https://codeforces.com/contest/1462)) before you actually enter for the first time. That way you can see who you would be if you actually competed in that competition.

After each competition, _editorial_ is published, ie the solution of the tasks with explanations. In case you are not familiar with some of the concepts you find in these solutions, we recommend that you _google_ them and try to solve this task with your new knowledge.

If you want to track your own statistics on Codeforces, you can use [this tool](https://recommender.codedrills.io/) which, based on the labels of tasks you have solved and those you have not been able to solve, assesses which categories are good and which are good. You still need to work and suggest exercise tasks based on this information.

We also advise you to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/E7ad4UGbrG) where you can find interesting people who are also involved in competition programming and who are ready to help you in case you get stuck somewhere.

In addition, as ridiculous as it may sound, it is important to know how to _google_ well. Whenever something is not clear to you or you get stuck somewhere, it is important to know how to ask a good question. [This YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEBkvm0-rg0) explains some of the more advanced _google_ methods very well. These materials talk about the general concepts needed to solve many problems, however, sometimes you get stuck in the implementation of a specific form of an algorithm and need help with it. For such situations, I recommend searching the [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) page where you can find specific implementations of certain algorithms.

Good luck with your learning!
